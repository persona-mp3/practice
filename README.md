TO START SERVER
---npm run start---

the sever will be listening to requests on port 8080


ABOUT

This repo is a revised architecture for my project.
As before, I would have the server rendering all the files under EJS templates, wether they really needed to or not
But this folder structure is optimal for me and the kind of projects I'm learning to buid
In this specific project, I implemeted a simple CORS featue here
The server only accepts requests that come from the live server on vscode (5500) 
if this isn't so for you, then you should contact me so we can troubleshoot it together if you need help

In foresight, this project will be migrating over to the Astro Framework with typescript on the front-end and potentially scss
The database for this has still not been decided upon yet, from a range of MySQL to Firebase or Mongo
I plan on learning a new one, but nothing beats native MySQL
